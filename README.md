## Repository Structure

This repository is meticulously organized to provide clarity and facilitate review. The following directories are included to categorize the work:

* **`notes/`**: A collection of detailed technical notes and theoretical summaries on fundamental deep learning concepts, algorithms, and model architectures.

* **`code/`**: This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts for various deep learning projects and exercises. Subdirectories are established to correspond with specific topics or project domains.

* **`projects/`**: This section is designated for more extensive and structured projects. Each project's subdirectory is self-contained and includes a dedicated README file to provide detailed context and an overview of its contents.
